An Eye for an Eye 

Albert’s perspective 

Earlier on today, I asked my best friend ‘Dani’ for his Netflix account details, since I've been having some financial problems. I was annoyed with his selfish response; he wanted me to “ask someone else as he and his family were using so he didn’t want me to watch my shows that could cause the Netflix algorithm to give him weird recommendations and his family would think it was him who watched it instead”. Obviously, I did understand his reasoning as systems like Netflix are based on machine learning that rewrite themselves as they learn from their own users. Every time you press play and spend some time watching a TV show or a movie, Netflix is collecting data that informs the algorithm and refreshes it. The more you watch the more up to date the algorithm is and so if I watched anything on his account, the system would refresh and recommend him shows that are not his taste and this can be annoying. However, this made me livid as he knows that I just lost my job because I got caught trying to hack into the finance database using a SQL injection to add more money to my salary. The SQL injection was easy to perform as all I had to do was go to the site which shows how much we are getting paid for each tasks we have done and how long we have worked for; I then wrote code instead of my username to trick the program to execute my username as a code, which got me admin access to change the values in the database. However, I didn’t expect that there was a camera in the finance office which caught me as I was messing with the computer and was fired then and there. Therefore, I expected some empathy from someone who I call my ‘best friend’. As we are both computer science students, I decided that the only suitable means for revenge would be a cyber-attack. As it would test his abilities as a computer scientist and allow for me to have some petty revenge. 

I initially decided on three potential ways and techniques that I could implement. A smishing text (SMS), phishing email or keylogger are some of the various ways that I could’ve used to get back at his and test his skills in cyber security. A smishing text is relatively easy to create as I already have his number and personal details. The definition of SMS phishing is “the act of committing text message fraud to try to lure victims into revealing account information or installing malware.” It is essentially a type of phishing which uses a SMS text message as its basis. All I need to do is make a simple text message, pretending to be Netflix, asking to update his account and card details for extra security. If he doesn’t notice any signs that signify the text message is fraudulent then he will likely provide his account details. However, this technique was useless as he and I have already done this many times to other people and it’s always hilarious when the other person starts madly reply to give his money back and that he would call the police, which would have done nothing as we sent it from a one-time number that belonged to no one. Therefore, this would be ineffective against him and he would easily recognise it and not open the link. 

A keylogger was another technique that I contemplated on using. It is a computer program that logs keystrokes from the victim computer system, with the user being unaware that they're being ‘monitored’. In order to gain access to private information, such as account details and passwords. If I were to utilise a keylogger to obtain Dani’s account details, then I would need physical access to his computer system. It would involve me, unzipping and installing the content from the keylogger (via USB) and returning later when I am ready to go through all his keystroke data. However, this would end up being a long-winded process, as I would need to install the keylogger covertly and be left with a large file of keystrokes to analyse. However, I would not even be able to do the first step as I haven’t met him in years, and I wasn’t about to meet him for just a Netflix account. Therefore, I decided on not using it as my tool of justice. 

 

This left me with my last and best option, using a phishing email. This is very similar to SMS phishing, but uses email as its basis- rather than text. It would allow me to gain access to Dani’s account details in the same way because I am essentially doing the same thing; impersonating Netflix and asking him to update his account information for security purposes. The email I use would’ve had to seem as trustworthy as possible and replicate the genuine Netflix email structure, to ensure he didn’t recognise it as a fraudulent email. I consider this the simplest technique out of all that I considered, I could simply go back to the past emails I had received from Netflix and copy the format as closely as possible. For this reason, I went ahead and chose the phishing email as my main option. Although knowing Dani he will most likely see through it as a phishing email, he can be a little slow at times, but he is far from stupid. The structure of the email was as follows: 

Subject: NETFLIX: Security verification required.

Dani’s perspective 

I received an email from ‘Netflix’ today, asking me to update my account details for extra security. Because there has supposedly been a suspicious number of log-in attempts made. Which I thought was odd; I don’t share my account details with anyone, the only way this could be possible is if someone in my family was sharing our account with their friends, although I specifically told everyone not to do that. Before considering that option I noticed that the structure of this email seemed off... there were various signs that lead me to conclude that this email was fake, and most likely a phishing attempt. I first checked if the email was sent from a public email domain. I compared this email address to past email I received from Netflix, in which the domain name was @Netflix.com. This immediately indicated that the email I received today was indeed a phishing email, because it did not have a public domain, instead it had a private domain. No legitimate company in the world would use this, especially a big corporation like Netflix. Therefore, this RedFlag 100% guaranteed that this was not a genuine email from Netflix. 

 

After noticing the domain name, I continued to look for any other clues within the email that would help me recognise it as a phishing email. I analysed the whole email and realised the spelling and grammar was awful, which should be expected from a legitimate company like Netflix. There were several spelling and punctuation mistakes that made the email seem very informal. Adding to the dead giveaway that this email was obviously a scam email. It also had a very generic greeting, “Hi dear”. A company email wouldn't refer to their customers as “Dear”, but rather with their name. 

Lastly, the most common indicator of a phishing email, it asks for the user to provide their private information. Such as account or bank details. The sender gives a link for the user to input this information in large bold text, further creating a sense of urgency. Scammers often use these suspicious links and attachments, to unleash malware that could perform any number of nefarious activities. 

After I reported this email and blocked the sender, I remembered something that would potentially explain the whereabouts of who sent it. My friend ‘Dani’ had asked for my account details earlier today, I said no of course. He then acted as he usually did, which was annoyed and petty and ignored my texts. This seemed odd at the time, but I disregarded it. However, after receiving the phishing email, I realised that Dani is aware of cybercrime and how to commit it and had the intent (due to me not giving him my account details). This all started to make sense, so I decided to play the ‘game’ and respond with a taste of his own medicine. 

I decided to take revenge by using a Denial of Service attack also known as a “DoS attack”, it floods the target’s network with traffic, or sending it information gat triggers a crash. And there are few ways to do it, the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the methods and most popular way. A DDoS is a large-scale Dos attack where the perpetrator uses more than one IP address or machines known as “zombies”, Machines that have been infected with malware, Thousands of these machines create what is known as a “Bot-Net,” A malware program is then used to synchronise all machines to ping your desired host. Overloading the system and eventually crashing it, until the attack is halted, or the Hosts IP is changed. 

 

A DDoS attack typically involves infected nodes from different networks attacking the same victim simultaneously. Due to all the incoming flooding traffic originating from different networks, it’s impossible to stop the attack by simply using ingress filtering, the attack renders the target machine unable to access any desired server; all the necessary traffic to access the server are unable to processed by the client due to the large amount of useless incoming requests sent by the “zombies” taking a considerable amount of time to process. The simplest way to describe how a DDoS attack works is by comparing it to highway traffic. Let’s say that the request from target machine is a red car, the internet is the highway road, and each of those many requests from “zombie” machines are individual black cars.  

If the target machine wants to communicate with a server via the internet, it would have to first send a request to the server, and that request is demonstrated by the red car. The red car needs to drive to the server as to deliver the user’s request, and to reach this destination the red car must drive through the highway, of which resembles the internet. As a DDoS attack is essentially just sending lots of useless requests to flood the victim, of which must sent through internet as well, this would mean that the black cars would flood the highway, which would cause an extreme traffic jam due to those black cars having to be slowly processed by the victim; the black cars would block the red car’s route, which results in the red car in being unable to reach the destination, therefore the request from the target machine is unable to reach the server, or may take large amount of time to reach as the red car must slowly wait for the black cars to move as to reach its destination.  

Whilst gaining revenge through such a method would be satisfying, gaining enough “zombies” to perform a successful DDOS attack would take a considerable amount of work and time. This is because I would have to illegally distribute malware to infect enough victims to establish a sufficiently large botnet which would be capable of performing the DDOS attack. The task of establishing such a botnet is far too great for petty revenge, not to mention the possibility of the authorities taking notice in my crime. 

Instead of spending my time infecting innocent victims to force them to fulfil my commands, I could simply utilize data breaches for my revenge. Data breaches vary, but usually contain useful personal information, if Albert’s personal information is revealed within the breach, I could use against it him. All I require is a unique piece of information to identify Albert’s personal information in the extensive list of breached information at my disposal. Luckily, I know one of Albert’s personal emails in addition to his full name, this should be sufficient as to allow me to identify him. While public access to breached data may be limited, the available data should be sufficient for my cause. The breached data could potentially reveal the plaintext password he has used in the past or other emails owned by him of which I am unaware of, which I could utilize.  

I will use the combination of his leaked emails and passwords to attempt to sign into various services in hopes of successfully logging into his account as to steal it by changing its associated email to a personal throwaway email and its password to one only known by myself. If I’m lucky, I may even gain access to one of his emails. Whilst attempting to log into various services by using his details, I may consider using a VPN. Not only would this allow me hide the fact that I’m the one attacking Albert, but also allow my IP to be geographically closer to Albert, as to prevent digital security measures from flagging my login attempt as being malicious due to the geographical difference between Albert and I. However, as my IP would still be different from Albert’s, my login attempt may be blocked. Whilst I would ideally like to have the same IP as Albert as to make it appear that Albert is logging in from his usual location and IP, it would require me to gain access to Albert’s network which would be far too difficult due to Albert’s computing knowledge preventing me from directly infecting him. 

If I’m unable to successfully login to a service using his details, I could resort to flooding his emails with spam. Similarly, to a DDOS attack, this would prevent Albert from viewing the useful emails he has received as his inbox would be flooded with a large amount of worthless emails. Although, this method would not be perfect due to anti-spam measures in modern emails, furthermore, there is no guarantee that I even find Albert’s information in a data breach which would render my plan worthless.
