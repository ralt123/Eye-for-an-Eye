The more you watch the more up to date the algorithm is and so if I watched anything on his account, the system would refresh and recommend him shows that are not his taste and this can be annoying.")

All I need to do is make a simple text message, pretending to be Netflix, asking to update his account and card details for extra security. If he doesn’t notice any signs that signify the text message is fraudulent then he will likely provide his account details. However, this technique was useless as he and I have already done this many times to other people and it’s always hilarious when the other person starts madly reply to give his money back and that he would call the police, which would have done nothing as we sent it from a one-time number that belonged to no one.

It is a computer program that logs keystrokes from the victim computer system, with the user being unaware that they're being ‘monitored’. In order to gain access to private information, such as account details and passwords. If I were to utilise a keylogger to obtain Dani’s account details, then I would need physical access to his computer system. It would involve me, unzipping and installing the content from the keylogger (via USB) and returning later when I am ready to go through all his keystroke data. However, this would end up being a long-winded process, as I would need to install the keylogger covertly and be left with a large file of keystrokes to analyse. However, I would not even be able to do the first step as I haven’t met him in years, and I wasn’t about to meet him for just a Netflix account.
